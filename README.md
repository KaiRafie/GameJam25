# **Root To Rise (RTR)**

## **Introduction**
**Root to Rise** is a 2D pixelated platformer game centered around the theme of growth. Players take on the role of a seed embarking on a journey to find the perfect place to grow into a magnificent tree. The seed goes through obstacles and needs to escape from insects that are trying to eat it, to survive and to go to the next level.

## **Core Gameplay**
- **Objective:**
  Navigate through levels as a seed, collecting water drops and sunlight to grow into a tree. Avoid obstacles like ants and pitfalls while progressing toward your goal. Getting planted is the main goal.
